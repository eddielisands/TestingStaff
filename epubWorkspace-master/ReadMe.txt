This is the code for My CodeProject Article about building an EPUB viewer for Android.
I placed it here to make it easier for me to apply bug fixes and additional features.
This code has the additional changes from the version on Code Project.
1. The list of epubs no longer crashes if the list won't fit on the screen.
2. (Limited) support for viewing Video embedded in and EPUB.

For more details on the code, please refer to the docs directory, or my original CodeProject article
at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/592909/EPUB-Viewer-for-Android-with-Text-to-Speech.
